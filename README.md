## Project Description

The Python project is designed to predict device prices, allowing sellers to classify device prices based on their characteristics. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Modeling Steps

### Data Preparing

1. **Load the Dataset**: Import the necessary libraries and load the training and testing datasets.
2. **EDA**: Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Normalize the features to improve model performance.
4. **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and validation sets.

### Evaluate Your Model

1. **Model Training**: Use a `RandomForestClassifier` for classification.
2. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate using metrics like confusion matrix and classification report.

### Optimize Your Model

1. **Feature Selection**: Analyze feature importance and remove less important features.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.

## Testing

Perform predictions for 10 devices from the test dataset.
